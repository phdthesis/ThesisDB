# Copyrights:

The aim of the shipofthesis.org is to make a crowd sourced database of PhD thesis, and the database just contains the github URL for your PhD thesis. This does not gives shipofthesis.org any rights to your work, you still retain all the rights. The U.S [copyright office](copyright.gov) has a compilation of [FAQ's](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html) that may be very usefull. To mention few important points:

>Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.

It is not required for your work to be registered with the U.S copyright office in order to be protected. If you did your research work at an american university, then it may help you to know that most of them only ask for permission to reproduce and distribute academic work to support the dissemination of intellectual thought and discovery. But you, the author, still owns the copyright and can choose to upload the thesis to github. 

The exception may be the situation where you explicitly trasferred all your rights for your research to a publishing house for publishing your thesis. So, if you have not published with a publishing house and believe in making your work available for everyone, we encourage you to upload your thesis to github and contribute the URL for your thesis repository to Ship of thesis.
